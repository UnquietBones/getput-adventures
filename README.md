# getput-adventures

As I learn (relearn) each language I'm creating a small text-based adventure game to hash out file I/O, user interfaces, and database queries. The first iterations will be horrible and clunky, but it should get better as I go on.

Feedback on better ways to do this is (as always) appreciated! :)

The adventures will continue on from each other and I'll try and provide the raw data needed for each setup. The story is up in the air at the moment, but if I get a proper storyline laid out, I'll note it here.

Who knows... maybe I'll add actual graphics by the time I get to trying out Unity!
