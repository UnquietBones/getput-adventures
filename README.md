# GetPut-Adventures

As I learn (relearn) each language I'm creating a small text-based adventure game to hash out file I/O, user interfaces, and database queries. The first iterations will be horrible and clunky, but it should get better as I go on.

Feedback on better ways to do this is -as always- appreciated! :)

Chapter 1 - Java 11 - This Old House (of Horrors?)
=======================

This is the first part of the adventure game. The player is exploring a small wooden house deep in the woods. For... reasons.

Basic Game Information
-------------------------------------------------

This game is intended to let the player move through the world as built in the text files. Changing the text files will change the game world, allowing you to build whatever you like! (As long as you follow the game rules.)

Currently the way to 'win' the game is to enter the room designated as the win room. There is a loop counter build in to make testing easier, so in theory hitting that it the 'lose' condition. There is no way to die. ...yet. ;)

Text Files
-------------------------------------------------
These will hold my story... once I finish writing it!
- actions.txt (Action ID/Action Name/Action Description/Action Command/Usage)
- items.txt (Item ID/Item Name/Item Description/Action ID/CanPickup)
- rooms.txt (Room ID/Room Name/Description/Items/Actions)

I built a set of four rooms to test every possible combination of the Actions that I could think of.
- testactions.txt
- testitems.txt
- testrooms.txt

Basic Libraries (aka info from the text files)

- GameMap - string array of all the Rooms Information (and their Items/Actions)
