# getput-adventures

As I learn (relearn) each language I'm creating a small text-based adventure game to hash out file I/O, user interfaces, and database queries. The first iterations will be horrible and clunky, but it should get better as I go on.

Feedback on better ways to do this is (as always) appreciated! :)

It woooooooooooooooooooooooooooooorks! :D

You can
- Pick up an item from a room
- Put down an item in a room
- Do an action (if you have the item in inventory and the action exists in the room)
- Use an exit
